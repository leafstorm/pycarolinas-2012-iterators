PyCarolinas Iterators
=====================
This was a talk I gave at PyCarolinas 2012 in Chapel Hill.

The entire talk was a giant live demo, which I realize in retrospect
was a bad idea. My speaker notes are in ``PyCarolinas Iterators.rst``,
and all the other files are the "slides" I used in my demo.

I used tmux to display them all in one terminal while I controlled the
presentation from another. (When you see a ``C-j`` in the notes, that's a
tmux key command. Your prefix key might be different -- the default is
``C-b``.) To load everything into your tmux session, use ``C-j :`` to open a
command prompt, and type in ``source-file tmux.conf``.
(The numbers in the notes only work if you only have one window open to
begin with, which should contain a Python prompt.)
